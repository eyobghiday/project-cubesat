abstract = {I am pleased to present NASA's 2018 Strategic Plan, outlining the direction for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) through 2021 and beyond. Our new strategic plan embraces the bold direction laid out for the Nation by President Trump in Space Policy Directive 1 and makes real the vision set forth by the National Space Council. The plan emphasizes achievement aligned to the three strategic themes of Discover, Explore, and Develop, as well as a fourth theme focused on the activities that will Enable our Mission. It provides the foundation for a U.S.-led return to the Moon for long-term exploration and use and to establish a foundation for eventual crewed missions to Mars and potentially beyond. It also reaffirms NASA's commitment to the advancement of science and aeronautics. The plan is intended to promote accountability and transparency for all of these efforts, while highlighting the tangible and intangible benefits these activities will return to the American people. The plan features key milestones to be achieved by the Agency and highlights our close cooperation and support from commercial and international partners. Our robust partnership and commercialization strategy incorporates private sector innovation into NASA missions. Strategic partnering allows the Agency to better focus on new initiatives, improves the efficiency and effectiveness of our missions, and strengthens national science and engineering capabilities, boosting U.S. global competitiveness. This plan emphasizes the importance of space exploration. NASA will maximize use of the International Space Station (ISS) to evaluate systems and options for safeguarding the health of astronaut crews, as we seek to deliver them safely to lunar and eventually Martian destinations and then bring them safely back to Earth. Targeted research onboard the station will focus on understanding how humans adapt to the space environment, developing the technologies needed for deep space missions, and enabling the economic development of low Earth orbit. We are looking to secure the Nation's long-term presence in low Earth orbit by partnering with industry to develop commercial orbital platforms and capabilities that the private sector and NASA can use after the cessation of direct U.S. Federal funding for ISS in 2025. NASA intends to shift its human spaceflight program out to the Moon and cis-lunar region, evaluating new habitat technologies, surface transportation systems, fuel generation, and storage solutions, as well as additional technologies that need to be developed prior to traveling to the surface of the Moon and deeper into space. In every domain, we intend to renew and strengthen our commitment to American commercial space companies, which are critical partners in the human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond. NASA will also build on its legacy of leadership in acquiring knowledge and understanding of the big questions in science, as well as the technologies of tomorrow. Through a steady cadence of focused, competitively sourced science missions, we will continue to lead the world in improving humanity's understanding of the Earth, the Sun, the planets in our solar system, and the secrets of the universe. Finally, NASA will continue to pioneer ground-breaking advances in aeronautics, where cutting-edge research including our partners in industry, academia, and other Government agencies will lead to improved air transportation safety and efficiencies. A lean and focused portfolio of fundamental and applied research allows engineers and scientists across the globe to seek and discover solutions for the safety and betterment of all. NASA 2018 Strategic Plan | 2 NASA acknowledges and is grateful for the steadfast support it receives from the Administration, Congress, and the American people. This strategic plan reflects a national consensus as depicted in the Administration's policy and budget, the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 and Congressional appropriations legislation, and the continued interest and excitement of the American people, who truly Enable NASA to Discover the scientific truth that governs our universe and beyond, to Explore new worlds, and to Develop unsurpassed science and engineering capabilities for the Nation.},

abstract = {The first multiple launch CubeSat mission, involving some 6 Cubesats as secondary payloads, and a primary commercial payload, took place June 30, 2003. The launch vehicle was Rockot KS of Eurockot Launch Services (Bremen, Germany) from the launch site Plesetsk, Russia with the following secondary payloads: • XI (X-(3U Cubesat with a total mass of about 4.5 kg) The primary payloads on this mission were: • MIMOSA of the Czech Astronomical Institute, Ondrejov, Czech Republic with a launch mass of 66 kg • MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars) of CSA (Canadian Space Agency), Saint-Hubert, Quebec with a launch mass of 51 kg • Monitor E mock-up of GKNPT Khrunichev Space Center, Moscow, Russia with a mass of 700 kg. The payload Monitor-E remains on the upper stage of the launch vehicle. The deployment strategy of Rockot KS employed MOM (Multiple Orbit Mission), based on the multiple re-ignition capability of its Breeze upper stage. Initially, the MIMOSA payload was being deployed into an elliptical orbit of 820 km x 320 km. After another impulse maneuver of the main engine, Breeze then deployed MOST, followed by the CubeSats into a sun-synchronous orbit of 820 km near-circular altitude at predetermined intervals. The Monitor-E mock-up will remain on the upper stage and will de-orbit together with Breeze into the atmosphere. The CubeSat launch was coordinated by UTIAS/SFL (University of Toronto, Institute for Aerospacestudies/Space Flight Laboratory) for CanX-1, AAUSat and DTUSat. A single P-POD of CalPoly was used for XI and CUTE-I as well as for CanX-1, AAUSat and DTUSat. This integrated system was dubbed NLS-1 (Nanosatellite Launch System-1). The second launch system, NLS-2, consisted of QuakeSat and its own dedicated P-POD. CubeSat orbits: Circular sun-synchronous orbit, mean altitude = 820 km, inclination = 98.73{\textordmasculine}, local equator crossing time at 6:00 and 18:00.},

@article{Cui2016,
abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for the rational assessment of lifetime costs on tall buildings due to hurricane-induced damage along the US Atlantic coastline accounting for plausible future warming climate scenarios. The hurricane simulation is based on Vickery's empirical model. Initially, regression errors in Vickery's model are discussed; some adjustments are proposed to enable hurricane simulation in future climates. After verification of the hurricane model's ability to simulate the results of the United States historical hurricane database, simulation of hurricane activity in future climates is examined. The warming climate scenarios are reproduced from the results of the community earth system model, maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Three different future climate scenarios, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, are considered. The influence of warming climate on two quantities, relevant to wind engineering, is examined: hurricane frequency and hurricane intensity. It is found that, in a warming climate environment, the hurricane frequency and hurricane intensity may vary depending on the RCP scenario. Therefore, the probability distribution of the wind speed in hurricane-prone areas of the United States, both coastal and interior areas, will also be influenced by the RCPs. The numerical methodology for computing wind speed probability distribution in a future warming climate, influenced by the various RCP scenarios, is subsequently coupled with an existing approach for structural performance analysis against wind hazards to predict the indirect effect of future warming climate on the structural intervention costs (i.e. repair costs), induced by the damaging winds. A 180-m tall benchmark building, located in Miami (Florida, USA), is used as one example of application in conjunction with a series of structural fragility curves, derived from a recent study for the same structure. The evaluation of lifetime intervention costs is later expanded to demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology to predict hurricane wind damage, if the location of the structure is moved to several other cities along the Atlantic coast of the United States.},

abstract = {Objectives: Only few studies evaluated whether hurricane preparedness impacts health. The PREPARE study addresses this gap. Methods: We recruited participants who had pertinent pre-hurricane data from the 364 San Juan. Overweight Adults Longitudinal Study (SOALS) and 125 patients with diabetes from Federally Qualified Health Center (COSSMA) in Puerto Rico. Participants aged 42–75 years completed interviews 20–34 months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We evaluated associations between self-reported hurricane preparedness and health and other related associations using logistic regression controlling for age, location, education and interview date. Results: Only 41% of participants reported high pre-hurricane preparedness; 25% reported gaps (moderate/low availability) in information and 48% reported gaps in resources for hurricane preparedness. Participants reporting lower pre-hurricane preparedness had higher reported hurricane-related detrimental health impact (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.31, 2.95) and higher odds (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 0.92, 4.68) of developing new non-communicable disease (NCD) compared to others. Post-hurricane drinking water disruption for ≥3 months versus none or less (OR = 2.76; 95% CI: 1.39, 5.47) and similarly diet changes due to cooking/refrigeration access (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.24, 3.07), and diet changes for ≥20 months due to finances/access to shops (OR = 2.83; 95% CI: 1.85, 4.32) were also associated with detrimental health impact. Conclusion: Lower preparedness was associated with higher detrimental impact of the hurricanes on overall health, and marginally significant impact on NCD. Future preparedness efforts could especially target means of coping with disruption of water services and regular diet, as these were also associated with detrimental health impact.},

abstract = {The severe damage to residential construction and the social disruption caused by hurricanes in the past two decades in the United States demonstrate the need for a better understanding of residential building performance and improved performance prediction tools if the goal of mitigating hurricane hazards is to be achieved. In this paper, probabilistic risk assessment methods are developed to assess performance and reliability of low-rise light-frame wood residential construction in the United States subjected to hurricane hazards. In a fully coupled reliability analysis, structural system fragilities are convolved with hurricane hazard models expressed in terms of 3-s gust wind speed. Alternate models for structural fragility used in such analyses are tested statistically. Sources of inherent variability and epistemic (knowledge-based) uncertainties due to competing plausible hurricane wind speed models and databases on structural resistance are explicitly included in the reliability analysis. The impact of epistemic uncertainties on structural reliability and their implications for risk-informed decision-making are examined. Comparison of reliabilities of building components that are essential to maintain the integrity of the building envelope highlights the need to design and detail those components to reduce the overall vulnerability of a building to hurricane effects. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Much has changed, both in the space community and in the larger world, in the years since the first edition of this classic, best-selling book appeared. While there is now a huge collection of core knowledge, tutorial material, mathematical "applets," and design data available about spacecraft systems engineering that did not exist when the first edition was published, the second edition continues to fulfill the book's original goal--that of linking and integrating the many disciplines relevant to the field of space systems engineering in a way that is impossible when they are considered separately, or even in one text that is the product of many authors. The text starts with an overall description of the basic mission considerations for spacecraft design, including space environment, astrodynamics, and atmospheric reentry. Then the various subsystems are discussed, and in each case, both the theoretical background and the current engineering practice are fully explained. Some material has been updated to make the treatment consistent with current experience and practice in the field. At the same time, there is much that remains relevant from what are now the earlier decades of the space program. Nothing of real value has been omitted merely on the grounds that it is old. This edition contains a new chapter on reliability analysis, much new technical material in other sections, and many homework problems. The book provides the space systems engineer with the tools to evaluate the overall impact of candidate design concepts on the various component subsystems and the integrated system leading to the final design selection. Despite the incredible richness of web-based resources for the modern engineer, it remains true that most web sites and links are exceedingly volatile. For that reason, the authors have chosen to include and reference only that which is accessible through archived references, creating an authoritative text that provides both suitable materials for senior-level courses in aerospace engineering and a useful reference for the practicing aerospace engineer.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses progress Fibertek is making toward development of next-generation remote sensing lidar technology for cube, micro, and small satellite (smallsat) platforms. Our general finding is that small, relatively inexpensive cube/micro/small satellite lidars are feasible and that numerous applications are possible. Lidar is not traditionally thought of as being suitable for cube and smallsat applications because of the cost, complexity, mass, and power typically associated with ground-and space-based earth and planetary lidars. This paper describes our performance modeling and concept lidar designs that are 2-4U in size, 2-3 kg, draw 10-25 W, and are capable of science and satellite proximity operations. This paper will discuss lidar concepts for multiple applications. Short-range proximity lidars are capable of 50-degree field of view (FOV), scanning angle up to 500 m and can support three-dimensional (3D) imaging for satellite rendezvous operations and comet/asteroid sample capture missions. Long-range cubesat lidar configurations can support up to 1,000 km range and can be used for planetary body topology mapping and altimetry. Lidars with multi-wavelength capability can measure surface properties of solid ices found in outer planets and moons and can tell the difference between liquid and solid phase. Cubesat atmospheric lidars can measure aerosol backscatter intensities and characterize cloud layer structures, for example, as seen around Pluto, Charon, and Enceladus. Lidar measurements of atmospheric gas including water, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane are also possible in small form factors.},
