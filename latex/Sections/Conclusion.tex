This concludes our design report for the project HurriSat. This low-earth orbit weather satellite will be used to study, monitor, and track hurricanes and other extreme weather across the east coast. This satellite meets the complete NASA’s strategic goal as shown earlier. i.e. to study the cause & effect of severe space weather events, and prevent potential damage. Hurrisat will also accomplish NASA’s strategic goal to address national challenges and catalyze economic growth for space sustainability.  This report outlines the mission exploration, architecture, the subsystem design, mission feasibility, and the further work needed for NASA's cubesat initiative project.
