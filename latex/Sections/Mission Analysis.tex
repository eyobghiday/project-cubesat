The mission of this project is to propose a Low Earth Orbit 6U sized Cubesat in order to track down the hurricanes across the South-Atlantic U.S. Region. The primary target coverage area is about 110,000 square miles across the South East-cost. This Cubesat should be able to track small to big size hurricanes across the given region. This is mainly achieved using high-tech dual cameras. It will try to collect the speed, impact area,  changes in temperature, pressure, and air composition of earthâ€™s atmosphere for a given radius in miles. By doing so, it has to communicate and transmit data back and forth between local stations effectively. Furthermore, we must ensure the recorded data is shared with the outlined stakeholders and interested parties effectively.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Requirements and Constraints}
After going over the mission requirements, the subsystem components are inspected and checked to see if they can meet the mission purpose.  Figure \ref{fig:ssreq} goes over all our subsystem designs and lists whether that specific component's requirement and constraint. This in return shapes our design and component selection process. \\

\subsection{Analysis and Trade Studies}
To ensure our project results in designing an effective and efficient cubesat, we have made a project plan to provide the best out put parameters in Figure \ref{fig:manplan}. After initial mission definition the project is closely followed by trade studies. Numerous data for previous successful missions were collected firsthand. The Japanese XI \cite{EoPortal2002} cubesat, the Freja \cite{Freja} cubesat, and the Firesat from the Space mission and design \cite{Larson1999} reference were used as a basis. Those projects solely match our functionality requirements for a 1U-12U cubesat. Figure \ref{fig:graph}(a) is the volume (density) of cubesats at various altitude. It shows 6U-sats are commonly used for a wide range of altitude. If HurriSat is to be equipped with a faster imaging cameras, and max transfer (bandwidth) frequency as shown in Figure \ref{fig:graph}(b), it will require high throughput (red-accent) power. The tradeoff is an increase in mass size as shown in Figure \ref{fig:graph}(c). The inclination distribution of cubesats is graphed in Figure \ref{fig:graph}(d) in order to provide some insight on satellite footprint with mass and altitude. 
Once we select the performance metrics, we use STK \cite{AGISolutions2021} software analysis to test the values in the simulation. After reading the feedback from the simulation; if the findings are feasible, we proceed to component design phase. If not, we go back to refine our mission definition and operational requirements. This is an agile project managing system where we select the performance parameters and perceive the coverage, operation orbit and bypass simultaneously to decide the best fit. This allows us to be flexible with the little time provided.

\subsection {Risk Assessment}
Risk assessment assures the stakeholders whether our cubesat  is on track to be hazard free, secure, safe, and scientifically feasible. It is impossible to avoid risks completely. Thus, the team has provided a risk assessment definition in Table \ref{Tab:rd}. Those definitions are basic guideline to help assessing the risks and provide some mitigation mechanisms. They are divided in to two sections: probability and severity. Probability is the likelihood of risk to occur, while severity is the effect of the risk. To determine the risk assessments a color grading scale is provided in Table \ref{Tab:rcg}. Bright red is a high probability  and extremely severe. This risk will definitely hinder all types of operation and may even lead to complete failure of the mission. Green on the other hand is quite the opposite.\\

Updated risk assessment are shown below. Risk assessment assures the stakeholders whether our cubesat  is on track to be hazard free, secure, safe, and scientifically feasible. It is impossible to avoid risks completely. 
Table \ref{Tab:tpr} is where we listed out every possible risk. While most of the risks are accounted for, there might still be an unforeseeable event due to sudden radiation exposure or unaccounted space debris. HurriSat will still be utilizing its propulsion driven ADCS guided by the active software tracking to avoid debris. It will also feature a double wall bumper in the structures to sustain slight damage. Similarly, some parts of the IC transistors will have to be embedded with carbon Teflon shielding to resist radiation and thermal exposure.\\
