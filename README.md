MMAE412 Spacecraft design project. Designing a small Cubesat for NASA CLSI. 

Illinois Institute of Technology is developing initital orbital satellite that tracks hurricanes and tornados in the South Eastern US region. Our device is a 6U Cubesat dubbed SixSat. This cubesat will use a reaction wheel system for attitude control and pointing of the onboard antennas and cameras. We are developing the controller, designing the structure and sourcing hardware for both the space rated system and a ground test system that will also be used for demonstration purposes in a MMAE412 SPACECRAFT DESGIN project.
