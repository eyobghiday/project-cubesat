MMAE412 Spacecraft design project. Designing a small Cubesat for NASA CLSI. 

Illinois Institute of Technology is developing initital orbital satellite that tracks hurricanes and tornados in the South Eastern US region. Our device is a 6U Cubesat dubbed SixSat. This cubesat will use a reaction wheel system for attitude control and pointing of the onboard antennas and cameras. We are developing the controller, designing the structure and sourcing hardware for both the space rated system and a ground test system that will also be used for demonstration purposes. This system has been tested using the Dryden Drop Tower at PSU as well as in captive hanging tests. The current controller is a simple proportional controller, however using data collected from the drop test I will refine the model and implement a more sophisticated controller.
